Syncing Docker Images from DockerHub to a Private Harbor Registry with Python 

Referenced in this [blog post](https://ted.meralus.com/docker-image-repo-sync/)

## Prerequisites
1. **Docker** installed on your local machine.
2. A **Harbor** registry set up. If you don't have one, follow [Harbor's installation guide](https://goharbor.io/docs/).
3. **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
4. The **Harbor API credentials** (username and password) to authenticate with your Harbor registry.
5. A Linux machine 

Note:  A Dockerhub account may be required for pulling private images but this script "currently" doesnt have that functionality.
